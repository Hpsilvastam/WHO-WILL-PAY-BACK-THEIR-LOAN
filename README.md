# WHO-WILL-PAY-BACK-THEIR-LOAN
For Credit Companies it is important to know beforehand who is able to pay their loans and who is not

Summary

Lending institutions rely on models and algorithms based on “hard” information collected by credit bureau agencies, as well as “within-account” and “across-account” data regarding customers’ past behaviour. However, these models can be static, and slow to indicate increased risk. Improving the speed and accuracy of the algorithms that banks use to measure risk is of extreme importance, and machine learning can play a significant role in improving performance. In May of 2017, I interviewed with a regional bank here in Brazil called Nubank, and they gave me a take-home challenge consisting of synthetic customer data, with the objective of analyzing risks. Now armed with the knowledge gained from Data Science's course, I can use machine learning to create improved methods of measuring risk.
